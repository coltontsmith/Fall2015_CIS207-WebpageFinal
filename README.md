# Fall2015 webpage final: Cheaha PC Repair

During my time at Gadsden State Community College, I had the pleasure of taking an introductory course in web-design. Throughout the semester we used using Expression Web to design and update our assignments in real time, focusing on basic implementation of the HTML5 and CSS3 laguages.

The project located within this repository is my submission for our final project. Our instructor required the following from us:
- Including the "index.html" page, at least 4 web pages.
- An external CSS stylesheet.
- At least one table, one form, and one unordered list.
- At least two external hyperlinks to outside sources.
- And as a final requirement, all images must either be non copywrited, or original works created by the students themselves.

The main prompt, or focus for this project was to create a webpage that you could design and publish for a local business, or as a mockup site for a ficticious entity; I chose the latter.

Like most open ended projects that I have been presented with in the past, it took some time for me to decide what the final product should resemble. I had a few rough drafts that I played around with, but nothing really felt right until I considered an electronics/PC repair shop. With my background in I.T. as both a profession and a hobby, it made perfect sense to design a website based on repairing computers. Of course, I still needed to design the website from sratch, but at least at this point I had an idea of which direction I needed to go.

Naming a business, both tangible and fictional is a very difficult task if the desired effect is to not sound like the location for a hokey comedy skit. I spent at least a full day mulling over ideas for names, even though this entity would only manifest itself through a mockup website. The thought of my imaginary business sounding silly bothered me more than anything else in the intial stages of design for some odd reason. Recalling various businesses in the area, I tried to notice if any sort of pattern or similarities may exist between the names of two or more businesses. To make a long story short, I eventually ended up with an almost patronizing name for the company based on my findings. Numerous businesses in the area took opportunity in incorporating the name of Alabama's largest mountain, Cheaha, which just happens to be located just south of Oxford. Overall I'm still fairly pleased with the decision to follow suite with everyone in the area.

So I have PC repair business and a name to associate it with, the only left at this point was to come up with a design and ensure it met all of the required criteria for the project. I didn't want to stress myself out over finding images that were comepletely non copywritted material, and I also wanted my project to stand out from the others, so I took what little bit of artistic ability I possed and started sketching out some original designs to go along with my project.

For the creation of the art, I used a Wacom Intuos Tablet for input, and Autodesk Sketchbook. This allowed me to easily create original images, and add a personalized touch to the website that I may have otherwise missed out on.

The site is a bit crude and by today's standards not exactly what I would call "aesthetically pleasing", but it was done. I had completed my project and was ready to check the consistency of every page, make last minute changes to an entry on the table, and change the color of the border ever so slightly before reverting to the previous shade. I gave it one last review, zipped the folder, and then in an act of paranoia checked the zip file just to ensure everything was where it needed to be after it would be opened by my instructor. I was happy with the changes and submitted my project. My instructor seemed pleased as well and assigned a favorable grade in the process.

This project allowed me to reconnect with my creative side, something I haven't had the pleasure of doing in quite a few years, and really made me appreciate how much work goes into creating and managing a large professional website.
