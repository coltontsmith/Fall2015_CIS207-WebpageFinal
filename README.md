# Fall2015 webpage final: Cheaha PC Repair

During my time at Gadsden State Community College, I had the pleasure of taking an introductory course in web-design. Throughout the semester we used using Expression Web to design and update our assignments in real time, focusing on basic implementation of the HTML5 and CSS3 laguages.

The project located within this repository is my submission for our final project. Our instructor required the following from us:
- Including the "index.html" page, at least 4 web pages.
- An external CSS stylesheet.
- At least one table, one form, and one unordered list.
- At least two external hyperlinks to outside sources.
- And as a final requirement, all images must either be non copywrited, or original works created by the students themselves.

The main prompt, or focus for this project was to create a webpage that you could design and publish for a local business, or as a mockup site for a ficticious entity; I chose the latter.
